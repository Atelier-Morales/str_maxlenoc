str_maxlenoc
============

A program that finds the biggest substring in a series of strings.

If there are substrings of a same size. The first occurence in the first argument will be displayed.

This was an actual exercise from an exam I had at School, which I failed miserably.  
I couldn’t live on with that feeling of shame, of not being able to code such a simple program and decided to do it properly 
(not without the helping hand of some friends though). 

I don’t think that will ever erase the bummer that exam was.

Feel free to copy and use it at your will.
